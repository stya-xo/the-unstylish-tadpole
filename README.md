🐸 The Unstylish Tadpole

Welcome to my dev diary —  a log of my journey into programming. 
This repo doesn’t hold code — it holds context.
Here, I link to the things I’ve built and track how far I’ve come.

## 📚 Learning Tracks

Each folder contains notes, reflections, and links to the projects I've built whilst following different learning paths:

- [`free-code-camp/`](./free-code-camp) — FreeCodeCamp
- [`odin-project/`](./odin-project) — The Odin Project
- [`cs50/`](./cs50) — Harvard's CS50
- [`ossu/`](./ossu) — Open Source Society University's CS curriculum
- [`misc-courses/`](./misc-courses) — One-off tutorials, challenges, and rabbit holes

## 🧪 Where’s the code?

All actual projects live in their own repos. 

## 💬 Why “Unstylish Tadpole”?

As a newbie who is unsure and flailing, but hoping to grow into a confident and effective developer,
I'm embracing the awkward early stages of learning and documenting the swim toward clarity.

But spoiler... maybe I wasn't a tadpole waiting to become a frog all along...
